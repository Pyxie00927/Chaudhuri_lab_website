She pursued her PhD in Molecular Biophysics at UT Southwestern Medical Center in the [lab of Dr. Lukasz Joachimiak](https://labs.utsouthwestern.edu/joachimiak-lab) in the Center for Alzheimerâ€™s and Neurodegenerative Diseases where she studied the folding and dynamics of intrinsically disordered protein tau and structural dynamics that impact its self assembles in tauopathies.
