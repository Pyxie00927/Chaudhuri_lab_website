# Our research
Cells in our body live in a 3-dimensional and often squishy world. Much of what we know about cell biology is based on studies of cells cultured on petri dishes, or rigid flat sheets of plastic. However, mammalian cells in soft tissues function in 3D microenvironments, which are soft and viscoelastic, and in which cells are surrounded by neighboring cells and an extracellular matrix. Importantly, cells sense and respond to the mechanical properties and dimensionality of the microenvironment, and a 3D microenvironment can be confining, serving as a physical barrier to processes such as cell migration or division that involve shape change or growth. We are interested in elucidating the mechanics of cell-matrix interactions in soft tissues. We seek to understand how the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix regulate processes such as breast cancer progression, stem cell differentiation, and cell division. Further, we aim to determine the biophysics of cell migration and division in confining 3D microenvironments. Our approach involves the use of engineered biomaterials for 3D cell culture and instrumentation to measure forces at the microscale relevant to cells.

#### We work on using biomaterials to study cell biophysics and mechanotransduction, and using them as tools for therapies including drug delivery.

### Extracellular matrix viscoelasticity and its impact on cells
<div class="col-md-7 order-md-1 ">

Many soft tissues are viscoelastic, exhibiting stress relaxation in response to a deformation. We have found that extracellular matrix viscoelasticity regulates various cellular behaviors, such as spreading, differentiation, matrix formation, matrix remodeling, migration, and division. We seek to how elucidate the mechanisms by which matrix viscoelasticity influences cell biology, and harness these insights towards the development of new therapies and applications in regenerative medicine. A key finding is that cells utilize stretch-activated ion channels to sense matrix viscoelasticity.

### Biophysics of cell migration

<div class="col-md-7 order-md-2">

Cell migration is critical for development, immune cell trafficking, wound healing, and metastasis. In many contexts, cells migrate through three-dimensionally confining microenvironments, where extracellular matrix pore size is smaller than that of the cells. For example, during cancer progression, carcinoma cells on the order of 10 microns in size must invade through a nanoporous basement membrane as a first step towards metastasis. We are investigating how cells push, pull, and degrade matrix in order to migrate through 3D tissue microenvironments. A particular area of interest is in understanding the role of matrix mechanical plasticity in mediating invasion and migration of cancer cells.

###  Cell division: force generation and mechanotransduction

<div class="col-md-7 order-md-1 ">

In many physiological contexts, cells divide in mechanically confining viscoelastic microenvironments, where they are surrounded by neighboring cells and ECM. Most of what is known about cell division is based on studies of cells dividing on 2D substrates, where they can simply release from the substrate and divide unrestricted. A mechanically confining microenvironment would be expected to restrict various morphological processes associated with cell cycle progression and cell division. We aim to uncover the how confinement impacts cell cycle progression, and how cells generate forces in order to divide in confining microenvironments.

Cell cycle progression in confining microenvironments is regulated by a growth-responsive TRPV4-PI3K/Akt-p27Kip1 signaling axis, in press.

### How does increased stiffness promote breast cancer progression?

<div class="col-md-7 order-md-2">


We are intrigued by the similarities in genetic epistasis and thermodynamic measurements and are applying these insights to large-scale studies of point mutants and posttranslational modifications. We attempt to connect the response to genetic (mutation), chemical (ligands), and physical (temperature) in experiments to define the basis of allosteric regulation and function. We like to bring an evolutionary biology perspective to the table to understand the relative importance of these different perturbations in shaping the proteins we see today.

### Tissue and biopolymer gel mechanics

<div class="col-md-7 order-md-1">

A major limitation of most biophysical techniques is the inability to directly reveal correlations in motions between distinct regions of macromolecules.
We are taking advantage of the new capabilities of next-generation X-ray free electron laser (X-FEL) light sources to perform radiation damage-free imaging of proteins and to watch how protein ensembles respond when perturbed by rapid temperature jumps using the X-FEL.
At equilibrium, X-ray diffuse scattering has the potential to reveal these motions; however, we currently lack the ability to collect, integrate, and refine diffuse scattering data.
Our long-term goal is to increase the information content of every X-ray diffraction experiment to reveal atomic level coupling at high resolution and improved models of grouped flexibility at low resolution.
